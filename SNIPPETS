TEXT SNIPPETS


Aquaponics can be defined as the combination of an aquaculture unit and a plant production unit with the objective to convert aquaculture wastes into edible yield. Against this background, the term “edible” implies several requirements with regards to the quality of the harvest such as appearance and uniformity as defined for instance by the International Standards for Fruit and Vegetables (OECD, 1962). Furthermore, it has to be emphasized that the final product needs to be competitive in price to be marketable and thus interesting for potential adopters of the technology. Though, it was found that the operating costs of an aquaponic system are higher than those of a hydroponic facility (Quagrainie, 2017). This might explain why most of the existing aquaponic systems operated are operated by hobbyists, scientists or serve demonstration purposes (Pattillo, 2022).

However, an early attempt to formulate a "designer diet" for aquaponics was made already three decades ago, with the result that the dissolved concentration of certain nutrients did not increase with an increase of its inclusion rate in the fish feed (Seawright, 1998). Though, the underlying constraints were not further investigated.
