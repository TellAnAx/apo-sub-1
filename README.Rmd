# Status of the Review
The most updated branch is **review**. The branch is based on the branch **visualminteq**, where all results were created using the Visual Minteq software.
The branch **gwb2022** holds the results of the calculations using The Geochemist's Workbench 2022 Community Edition. It is no longer maintained as the results are lacking considerations of dissolved organic matter (DOM).
