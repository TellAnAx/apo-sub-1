### TO DO ###


GENERAL

- Ask for permission to use image Stumm & Morgan - Aquatic Chemistry



INTRODUCTION

- Finish Feed section



MATERIAL AND METHODS

- Correct number of publications and observations in Fate assumptions
- Check amount of feed (250 g feed input is based on stocking density, not on biomass. Does this affect all calculations?)



RESULTS

-Recalculate daily necessary buffer input
- Add daily inputs of nutrients by aquafeeds to table
- Rework R/wrangling_logQK.R so that the plot shows the correct ions!!!
