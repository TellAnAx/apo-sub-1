\section{Introduction}
The "aquaponics principle" is generally seen as a sustainable method to recover nutrients from aquaculture waste streams by converting them into edible yield \parencite{Forchino2017}. However, while some researchers describe aquaponic systems as superior in plant growth in comparison with conventional hydroponic systems \parencite{Delaide2016}, others highlight inferior growth performance of the crops. The latter group is often referring to imbalances in the plant nutrient profile of aquaculture effluents as one causative factor \parencite{Seawright1998, Goddek2015}. Despite these claims, no closer attention was paid to the chemical mechanisms determining the composition of the effluents from aquaculture systems until now.
